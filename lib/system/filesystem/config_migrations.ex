  @moduledoc """
    Migrates a state map to the current form.

    # Heres how they work
      * this module lists all the files in "#{:code.priv_dir(:farmbot)}/migrations"
      * it sorts them in order of dates.
      * those files are just elixir script files `*.exs`
      * said file must export ONE module, with one function function named `run\1`
      * it takes a json map, and must return that map, but updated
      * when the migration runs successfully, it writes a file under the same name, but with `.migrated` at the
         _end of the file name, so we know not to migrate this again.
      * does this for every file in the list, passing the last one to the next one.

    # example
      * we needed to change "steps_per_mm" from an integer, to a map: `%{x: int, y: int, z: int}`
      * so we took the version with an int, and changed it, and returned the new verion. Simple.
